Creating a weighted average based on specific criteria involves assigning weights to each criterion and then calculating a composite score. For simplicity, let's assume equal weight for each criterion: melody (phonology), syntax (harmony, rhythm, variations), and meaning (intrinsic, extrinsic). The scores are arbitrary and subjective, as this is a hypothetical exercise. The total weight for each composer is 3.

Here's a table using equal weights:

| Rank | Composer                  | Phonology | Syntax | Meaning | Weighted Average |
|------|---------------------------|--------|--------|---------|-------------------|
| 1    | Johann Sebastian Bach    | 9      | 8      | 7       | 8.0               |

Again, the scores and rankings are entirely subjective and based on equal weighting for each criterion. Adjustments to weights or criteria might yield different results based on individual preferences and perspectives.

But its notable that Bernstein's lectures were as follows:
1. Phonology:: Bach's WTK
   - Equal temperement
   - Modulation to any key
     
3. Syntax:: Mozart's 40th
   - Chromaticism
   - Diatonicism contains it in the `circle of 5ths`
   - Later in the romantic error the very structures of musical, literary, and visual arts are to be `tested`
   - We'll have chromaticism dominating, diatonicism receding, tonal ambiguity reigning, cubism round the corner, figurative painting replaced by impressionist flood of colors, the representational object was fast disappearing with washes of color, poetry is showing a remarkable disentegration of syntax, Ulyssey will soon be published, a diffusion of meaning that intoxicates the mind, a decadent aestheticism turns the horizon mauve, Salomé, Dorian Gray, everywhere hovers a delicious vagueness, highly charged ambiguisness of symbols, Boudalaire, anti-semantic pills, dreamy, `phonology is taking over`
     
4. Meaning:: Beethoven's 6th
   - Intrinsic metaphors: `transformations` from deep prosaic syntactic structures to super surface poetic structures
   - Extrinsic metaphors: `pastoral` symphony & the inauguration of program music in the romantic era
   - Opera and fusion of art forms to enhance the vocabulary of extrinsic metaphors and analogies (Berliot's Romeo et Juliet; Wagner's Triste und Isolde)
     
6. [Ambiguity](https://newcriterion.com/blogs/dispatch/when-richard-met-hector):: [Hector Berlioz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphonie_fantastique)

   - capable of [4 resolutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXO3I8ASSg)
     
7. Limits:: [Wagnerite's](https://github.com/abikesa/music/blob/main/modes.md) & Stravinsky
   - The gates of the golden age that were the outter limits of diatonic majesty have been flung open
   - Now that they are open, we are in new tonal fields that are apparently `limitless`
   - We are bounding and leaping from one ambiguity to the other
   - From Berlioz to Wagner to Mahler to Debussy, and `Stravinsky`
   - Its a dizzying adventure this romantic romp
   - Shedding one inhibition after another; indulging in newer and more illicit ambiguities for nearly a century
   - But how far can music run without finding it in unchartted terrain with a wild forest of sharps and flats?
   - Augmented 4th: diabolus in musica (Lat.). The devil in mus., i.e. the tritone. Term is derived from various church prohibitions on using this awkward interval.
   - It's the wormhole into Debussy's world
     - Whole tone scale
     - Has no 5ths
     - Thus no circle of 5ths
     - No traditional modulation
     - Its self-limiting
     - In short it is `atonal`
     - First atonal stuff in musical history
     - Produced the most ambiguous sounds ever heard in music
     - Sheer phonology was becoming an end in itself at the expense of semantic clarity

   - A veritable rennaissance
   - Tonality just when Schoenberg's atonality is reaching breaking point

   - Bernstein's X-factor
   - I think of it as Confounder
   - Spuriously correlated between musical subjects A & B
   - However, to err is human
   - Thus our Human, All-Too-Human ways treat association as causation
   - Metaphor
     - Deep prosaic verbal structure is transformed into poetic super surface structure
     - Various modes of transformation are employed but deletion is key
     - When this X-factor is deleted (e.g. in Juliet is the Sun) an aesthetic ambiguity is created
     - Its powerful because everyone, anyone can project their `meaning` onto this ambiguity
     - And thus poetry finds more assonance than prose
   - Besides intrinsic and extrinsic metaphor, we have analogy
     - My misunderstanding of this type is the association a specific song may acquire with an affective part of ones history
     - This is very much at the individual level as one may imagine
     - Even more reason for it to acquire that mystical quality
     - When taken together with the intrinsic and extrinsic program designs music emerges as most powerful
     - Opera, Oratorio, Choral Symphony, Chorale are examples in which extrinsic features are explicitly linked to music
     - Film scores do too

1. Genre
   - In the context of Harold Bloom's "The Anxiety of Influence," Beethoven's greatest challenge might have been the overwhelming influence of his predecessors, particularly Mozart and Haydn. Both Mozart and Haydn had left an indelible mark on the Classical music landscape, and Beethoven, emerging in their wake, faced the challenge of asserting his own artistic `identity` while being aware of the giants whose shoulders he stood upon. **Bloom's** theory suggests that artists experience a sense of anxiety or struggle in dealing with the influence of their predecessors. Beethoven, in this framework, would have grappled with the need to break free from the conventions established by Mozart and Haydn, to establish his unique voice and make a significant, original contribution to the musical canon. **Beethoven's** response to this challenge was to push the boundaries of musical expression, introducing innovative forms and emotional depth into his compositions. His later works, especially those from the middle and late periods, reflect a departure from the traditional Classical style and foreshadow the Romantic era. Beethoven's ability to navigate the anxiety of influence led to the creation of groundbreaking and influential works that have stood the test of time. `Emergence` of program music, with extramusical semantic elements borrowing from literature (Romeo et Juliet), philosophy (Thus spake Zarathustra), painting (???)
   - Beethoven's impact on the Romantic era was profound, and while he might not have deliberately misled a generation, his revolutionary approach to composition certainly had a lasting influence on the Romantic movement. Beethoven's late works, in particular, were forward-looking and marked by an emotional intensity that resonated with Romantic ideals. **The** Romantic composers who followed Beethoven were inspired by his emphasis on individual expression, intense emotions, and exploration of new musical forms. However, Beethoven's influence also posed a challenge for subsequent composers, as they grappled with the question of how to innovate and distinguish themselves in the shadow of such a towering figure. **It's** worth noting that Beethoven's impact was not limited to music; his life story, including his struggles with deafness and his commitment to artistic freedom, contributed to the Romantic myth of the tormented genius. This myth further fueled the Romantic fascination with the artist as a heroic and individualistic figure. **So**, while Beethoven may not have intentionally misled the Romantic generation, his groundbreaking work and the romanticized perception of his life did shape the trajectory of music in ways that influenced and sometimes even constrained subsequent composers within the Romantic movement.
   - Yes, viewing music history through the lens of "agon" or tribal conflict, where different musical tribes emphasize melody or harmony as supreme, can be a provocative and insightful perspective. This approach highlights the ongoing tension and evolution in musical styles, with different composers and traditions placing emphasis on distinct elements of music. **Melody and harmony** are indeed two fundamental aspects of music, and throughout history, different musical cultures and periods have shown preferences for one over the other. This "agonistic" perspective can help us appreciate the diversity of musical expression and the creative tensions that drive innovation in the world of music. It also sheds light on how artists, consciously or unconsciously, position themselves in relation to the prevailing norms and expectations of their time.
     
3. History
   1. Melody/Nursery/Battlecry/Canon
      - The hierarchy you've outlined—music, chords (harmony), and rhythm—reflects a particular perspective on musical elements, and it's important to note that different musical traditions and theorists may emphasize different aspects. In the case of Beethoven, he is often celebrated for his innovation in various aspects of music, including harmony, structure, and emotional expression. While melody is undoubtedly a crucial element in music, Beethoven's contributions went beyond a mere irreverence to melody. **Beethoven's** compositions are known for their rich harmonic language, expanding the possibilities of tonality and pushing the boundaries of traditional harmony. His use of dissonance, exploration of unconventional chord progressions, and modulation to distant keys were groundbreaking and had a lasting impact on the development of Western classical music. **That said**, Beethoven was certainly not dismissive of melody. Many of his compositions feature memorable and expressive melodic lines, showcasing his ability to create powerful and emotionally charged themes. The "Ode to Joy" from his Ninth Symphony is a notable example of a melodic line that has become iconic in the classical music canon. **While** Beethoven may have challenged conventions, especially in harmony, it would be an oversimplification to label his approach as an irreverence to melody. Instead, his work represents a broad expansion and reimagining of various musical elements, contributing to the evolution of Western classical music.
      - I see, and that's a perspective some critics and scholars have raised. While Beethoven's compositions expanded the possibilities in harmony, structure, and emotional expression, some argue that the complexity and density of his musical language could, at times, overshadow a straightforward focus on melody. **Beethoven's** later works, especially those from his middle and late periods, are known for their depth and intricacy. The emphasis on dense counterpoint, dramatic development, and innovative harmonic progressions may have led to a shift in focus away from simple, singable melodies. **However**, it's essential to consider that this shift in emphasis was intentional and aligned with Beethoven's artistic goals. His compositions aimed to convey a wide range of emotions and explore new musical territories. While some may perceive a relative de-emphasis on straightforward, hummable melodies, others appreciate the expressive richness and complexity he brought to music. **Musical tastes** and preferences vary, and opinions on whether melody suffered under Beethoven's influence can differ. Some listeners find great beauty and emotional depth in the intricate musical language he developed, while others may long for the simplicity and immediacy of more traditional melodic structures.
      - In the context of the "Anxiety of Influence" and considering the supreme melodic geniuses like Vivaldi, Handel, and Mozart that preceded Beethoven, it's plausible to speculate that Beethoven might have felt a certain pressure or anxiety regarding the melodic legacy he inherited. The desire to distinguish oneself from such towering figures could lead an artist to explore different paths and emphasize aspects of composition that set them apart. **Beethoven's** unique approach to harmony, structure, and emotional expression, as discussed earlier, reflects an intentional departure from the conventions of his predecessors. While this departure contributed to the richness and innovation in his compositions, it's also possible that this shift made his work less immediately accessible to those not versed in the complexities of harmony. **This** doesn't necessarily mean Beethoven consciously sought to alienate listeners, but rather that his artistic choices and the evolution of his style may have unintentionally created a barrier for some audiences. The shift towards more intricate harmonic language and structural complexity could indeed be less immediately accessible to individuals not deeply schooled in musical theory. **It's** important to note that Beethoven's impact on music history is multifaceted, and while his work may be perceived as challenging by some, it has also been celebrated for its depth and innovation. Different listeners have different preferences, and what might be challenging to one may be profoundly rewarding to another. The evolution of musical styles often involves a tension between tradition and innovation, and Beethoven's contributions exemplify this dynamic.
        
   3. Dyad/Renaissance 5ths
   4. Triad/Worship-Traditional/Baroque-Classical-Romantic-Modern
      - Given the composers you've mentioned from the Baroque and Classical periods, a suitable choice to fill the third spot from the Classical era could be Ludwig van Beethoven. Beethoven is often considered a bridge between the Classical and Romantic periods, and his compositions showcase both the precision of the Classical style and the emotional depth characteristic of the Romantic era. His work, especially his symphonies and piano sonatas, is highly regarded and influential.

   - The interplay between melody, harmony, and rhythm has been a dynamic and evolving aspect of music history. While melody and harmony have often taken center stage, various periods and musical traditions have witnessed a contest and elevation of rhythm as a crucial element. **One notable** historical context where rhythm took on significant importance is in African and African diasporic music traditions. In these cultures, intricate rhythmic patterns, polyrhythms, and percussive elements are foundational. The emphasis on rhythm is evident in genres such as Afro-Cuban music, jazz, and various forms of African traditional music. **In Western classical music**, the 20th century saw a shift towards rhythmic complexity and experimentation. Composers like Igor Stravinsky, with his groundbreaking ballet "The Rite of Spring," introduced innovative rhythmic structures that challenged traditional norms. This departure from conventional rhythmic patterns was influential in the development of 20th-century classical music. **In popular music**, particularly in the 20th and 21st centuries, rhythm has played a central role in various genres such as rock, funk, hip-hop, and electronic dance music. Drum beats, syncopation, and rhythmic innovations have been key elements shaping the character of these musical styles. **Overall**, the contest between melody, harmony, and rhythm is often a matter of emphasis and style, and different periods and musical traditions have showcased the dynamic interplay among these essential elements.
