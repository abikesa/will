4. Qualities
   - Stravinsky's music like Joyce's `polyglot` masterpiece, Ulysseys
   - Through the mask of a seeming classical form: `allusion` to Homer's Odyssey
   - Craddles in the arms of Odyssey but suckle's on every style
   - From Chaucer, to ... this mornings tabloid
   - Quentin Tarantino is all about [sus chords](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mnb_3ibUp38)
   - Mozart is all about the the `classic triad` as we witness in Lacrimosa, using the melody "pocket" for suspension (2nd, inv), premonition (aug, 6th), resolution (dom7), and tension (#9, b9)
      - root
      - sus2 (not yet encountered in Mozart)
      - 3rd & b3
      - inversion (2nd) in lieu of sus4
      - perfect 5th
      - aug
      - 6th (a favorite of his)
      - min7b5 (half) dim - secondary dom (with #9-b9 melody)
      - diatonic & chromatic melodies
      - 11th & 13th (yet to be encountered)
        
5. Voicing
   - The melody in Lacrimosa is stepwise ascent
      - 8 steps on diatonic scale (D4-D5)
      - 8 steps on chromatic scale (E5b-B5b)
         - Voice lead at this point in bass is counter point chromatic descending from C-Bb-A-Ab-G-Gb-F-A  
6. Bounce
   - Primitive corporeal dance rhythms
