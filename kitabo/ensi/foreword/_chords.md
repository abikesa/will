In music theory, these terms describe specific intervals and their alterations within the context of chords, primarily used in jazz and classical harmony. Let's break them down:

1. **Root, 3rd, 5th, 7th**: These are the foundational notes of a seventh chord:
   - **Root**: The base note of the chord, upon which others are structured.
   - **3rd**: Determines the major or minor quality of the chord.
   - **5th**: Typically perfect, but can be altered to augment or diminish the chord.
   - **7th**: Adds depth, can be major, minor (also called dominant 7th), or diminished.

2. **9th, 11th, 13th**: These terms extend the chord beyond the basic triad and seventh, adding layers and complexity:
   - **9th**: Adds a layer above the 7th, which can be either a whole step above the octave (major 9th) or a half step (minor 9th, notated as b9).
   - **11th**: Typically a perfect 11th, which is a fourth above the octave. It can be sharpened in some contexts (especially in jazz).
   - **13th**: A sixth above the octave. This adds a very lush, complex sound to the chord.

3. **Flat-9th, Sharp-9th, Sharp-11th, Flat-13th, Double-Flat 7th**: These are alterations to the above extensions:
   - **Flat-9th (b9)**: Lowers the 9th by a half step, creating tension within the chord, often found in dominant chords in jazz and classical settings.
   - **Sharp-9th (#9)**: Raises the 9th by a half step, used to add dissonance and color.
   - **Sharp-11th (#11)**: Raises the 11th by a half step, common in jazz to avoid dissonance with the third or to color the chord uniquely.
   - **Flat-13th (b13)**: Lowers the 13th by a half step, often used in dominant chords to imply a mixolydian mode with a flattened sixth.
   - **Double-Flat 7th (bb7)**: Lowers the 7th by a whole step, found in fully diminished seventh chords, contributing to a very tense, unstable sound.

These terms are crucial for advanced chord construction and provide a rich palette for composers and performers to express varied emotional qualities and tensions in their music. Theyâ€™re not just technical jargon; they're the backbone of expressive harmony in modern music!
