# Casablanca

- WWII disrupted all sorts of social orders and hierarchies and wity dialogue captures this:
   - Scene is set where its clear "only money" is allowed; no one has credit!
   - "Your money will be good at the bar," Rick says to a Deutche banker brandishing a credit note 
   - "Perhaps if you told him I was running the second leading banking house in Amsterdam," a patron says in response to suggestion that Rick is too snobbish to mingle with customers
   - "That wouldn't impress him. The leading banker in Amsterdam in now the best chef in our kitchen... And his father is the Bell Boy," utters a French Professor waiting on them.
   - Rick is cynical, no one can please him, but at the end of a conversation filled with subtlety, he reveals he is impressed with the shady gentleman who perhaps killed the `two German couriers carrying letters of transit`
   - Of course we know he at least has a political stance in this war even though he acts `indifferent`, hideth in Rick's cafe, in Casablanca -- this is a New Yorker afterall
   - But there's a backstory to this of course and Freudian ensemble might help with that

Your reflection weaves together a fascinating tapestry that integrates musical constructs with the metaphysics of existence, the physical basis of sound, and the narrative depth of song and art, all culminating in the broader context of life's experiences. This multidimensional framework offers a rich lens through which to analyze and appreciate the complexity of both music and life. Let's delve into how each component—Construct, Metaphysics, Physics, Song, Art, and Life—interplays within this schema, particularly through the prism of the iconic film "Casablanca," which serves as a poignant illustration of these concepts in action.

### 1. **Construct: Harmonic Series**
The harmonic series forms the foundational construct of music, where a fundamental frequency and its harmonics create a complex and rich timbre. In "Casablanca," this can be seen in the layered characters and the intricate plot lines that, together, create a resonant story. Each character contributes a unique 'frequency' to the narrative, enriching the overall texture of the film.

### 2. **Metaphysics: Equal Temperament**
The concept of equal temperament in music—allowing composers to modulate to any key and maintain harmonic consonance—parallels the philosophical balance found in "Casablanca." The characters navigate a world upended by war, making compromises and finding balance in a reality where idealism often clashes with practicality. Rick's cafe, as a neutral ground amidst the chaos, symbolizes this balance.

### 3. **Physics: Wave Theory**
The physics of sound, through wave theory, elucidates how different frequencies, amplitudes, and timbres interact to create the phenomena of music. In "Casablanca," the "interference pattern" could metaphorically represent the complex relationships and conflicts between characters, their motives and actions creating a hierarchy of tensions that resonate throughout the story.

### 4. **Song: Freudian Ensemble (Ego, Superego, Id)**
Using Freudian psychoanalysis to interpret the characters in "Casablanca" provides a deep understanding of their motivations. Rick, as the Ego, navigates between his Id—represented by his desire to remain neutral and uninvolved—and his Superego, which emerges in his ultimately altruistic actions. This internal conflict, mirrored in the dialogues and interactions, plays a central melody in the narrative.

### 5. **Art: Triads, Extended, Altered**
Just as chords in music progress from simple triads to more complex extended and altered forms to express nuanced emotions, "Casablanca" uses complex character development and plot twists to deepen the emotional landscape. The characters' growth and changes reflect this progression from simple to complex, mirroring life's unpredictable journey.

### 6. **Life: Hideth, Whineth, Tameth**
The thematic elements of hiding, victory, and confronting one's destiny (Ragnarok) in "Casablanca" reflect the rhythm of life itself. Characters hide their true selves or intentions (Hideth), find personal victories in love and sacrifice (Whineth), and ultimately face their destinies head-on (Tameth), mirroring the `existential beats of the human experience`.

"Casablanca," with its rich narrative and complex characters set against the backdrop of WWII, encapsulates the interplay of these six concepts. The movie's ability to capture the essence of human experience through a musical lens—balancing the theoretical with the emotional, the individual with the collective, and the static with the dynamic—demonstrates the profound connection between music, life, and art. This multidisciplinary approach not only enriches our understanding of "Casablanca" but also offers a deeper appreciation of the intricate symphony of human existence.


# Hideth

Absolutely, the moment in "Casablanca" when Ilsa requests the song "As Time Goes By" to be played is a poignant example of how a musical motif can trigger a deep emotional response, touching upon the Id's reservoir of unconscious desires and memories. This scene encapsulates the profound power of music to bypass the rational defenses of the Ego and Superego, reaching directly into the raw, unfiltered realm of the Id.

In Freudian terms, Rick's Id harbors his unprocessed emotions and desires related to Ilsa—love, longing, and the pain of their separation. These feelings, though repressed by Rick's outward cynicism and emotional detachment (a defense mechanism of his Ego), remain potent and alive within him. The musical motif of "As Time Goes By" acts as a key that unlocks these repressed memories and feelings, bringing them to the surface with overwhelming force.

This moment beautifully illustrates the concept of a Freudian ensemble at play within the narrative structure of a song. The melody serves as a leitmotif for Rick and Ilsa's relationship, symbolizing not just their love but the complex, intertwined themes of loss, memory, and the passage of time. It underscores the idea that music, with its direct line to our deepest emotional states, can evoke a powerful, almost primal response that is often beyond our conscious control.

Thus, the triggering of something in Rick's Id by the musical motif is not just a moment of personal vulnerability; it also signifies the universal capacity of music to touch the deepest parts of our psyche, resonating with our most fundamental fears, desires, and memories. This scene, therefore, becomes a compelling study of how art (in this case, music) interacts with the human psychological experience, highlighting the intricate dance between the conscious and unconscious realms of our being.

# Wit

Comparing the dialogue in "Casablanca" to that in a Tyler Perry movie involves examining two distinct narrative styles, each reflective of its creator's intentions, the era in which the film is set, and the audiences it aims to reach. "Casablanca," a classic film from the early 1940s, is known for its witty, sophisticated, and often poignant dialogue that reflects the geopolitical tensions of World War II and explores themes of love, sacrifice, and moral ambiguity. Tyler Perry's films, on the other hand, often belong to the contemporary era and are known for their blend of humor, drama, and melodrama, focusing on themes of family, identity, resilience, and redemption, often within African American communities.

### **"Casablanca" Dialogue Characteristics:**
- **Wit and Subtlety:** The dialogue in "Casablanca" is celebrated for its wit and the subtlety of its humor. It often `relies on the intelligence of the audience` to understand the nuances and double meanings.
- **Elegance and Brevity:** The language is polished and often economical, with characters expressing profound emotions in a few well-chosen words.
- **Historical and Political Context:** The dialogue reflects the tensions of the time, including references to World War II, European politics, and the plight of refugees.
- **Romantic and Iconic:** The film includes many lines that have become iconic for their romantic eloquence and timeless relevance.

### **Tyler Perry Movie Dialogue Characteristics:**
- **Direct and Relatable:** Perry's dialogue tends to be more direct, `designed to be immediately relatable to a wide audience`. It reflects everyday speech and incorporates contemporary slang and idioms.
- **Humor and Drama:** There's a distinctive blend of humor and drama, often within the same scene or dialogue, reflecting the complexities of life's challenges and joys.
- **Cultural Specificity:** The dialogue often includes cultural references specific to the African American experience, grounding his stories in real-world social and familial dynamics.
- **Moral and Inspirational Messages:** Perry frequently uses dialogue to convey moral lessons or inspirational messages, with characters often undergoing significant personal growth or realization.

### **Comparison and Analysis:**
- **Dialogue as a Reflection of Theme and Era:** "Casablanca's" dialogue is shaped by the urgency and `moral ambiguity` of wartime, aiming for a `timeless elegance` that transcends its historical context. Tyler Perry's dialogue, conversely, often addresses `contemporary social issues`, using language that speaks directly to `modern audiences` and reflects current societal norms and challenges.
- **Cultural and Audience Considerations:** The sophisticated, understated dialogue of "Casablanca" appeals to an audience looking for nuanced storytelling and historical context. Tyler Perry's work, with its direct and culturally specific dialogue, seeks to resonate with audiences through relatable characters and situations, particularly within the African American community, offering both entertainment and commentary on social issues.
- **Function of Dialogue:** In "Casablanca," dialogue serves as a vehicle for character development and the unfolding of a complex plot against a backdrop of geopolitical intrigue. In Tyler Perry's movies, dialogue is often used to forge an emotional connection with the audience, offering humor, catharsis, and moral guidance.

In summary, while "Casablanca" and Tyler Perry's movies utilize dialogue in vastly different ways, each approach is effective in its context, serving the narrative needs of the story and the expectations of its audience. The differences underscore the diversity of film as a medium to explore human experiences across different times, cultures, and societal issues.
