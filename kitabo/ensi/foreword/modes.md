1. Johan's WTK
2. Hector's "Tristan" 
3. Ludwig's Pastoral
4. Mozart's 40th
   - Pedigree of musical `phrases` or melodies
   - Mozart's heirs are Schubert & Chopin - masters of singable
   - But Haydn, Beethoven, Wagner solidified the shorter `motifs`
   - These are much more amenable to Chomkians transformations: deletion, inversion, etc
   - Quite an enduring legacy since even Stravinsky, Bernstein, and [Sondheim](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-special-panic-of-singing-sondheim) were ensnared by these "less singables"
   - Disipense with MCR as we know it and adopt:
     - Melody: motifs
     - Chords: polytonality
     - Rhythms: polyrhythms (within which are embedded motifs... melodies wouldn't snuggly fit); mottos, ritual, primitive chants
     
6. Wagner's disciples
      1. **Richard Strauss:** A German composer, Strauss was heavily influenced by Wagner's orchestrations and dramatic use of the orchestra. His tone poems, such as "Also sprach Zarathustra" and "Ein Heldenleben," exhibit Wagnerian influences. **The influence of Richard Wagner** can be seen in the work of several composers who came after him, often referred to as his heirs. Some notable composers influenced by Wagner include Strauss, Mahler, Debussy, and Schoenberg. **In the Western classical music tradition**, Richard Wagner is often credited with `pushing tonal music to its limits`. Wagner, a 19th-century German composer, is known for his innovative use of harmony, orchestration, and form. His operas, such as "Tristan und Isolde" and "The Ring Cycle," contain chromaticism, unresolved dissonances, and extended tonal structures that challenged the conventions of the time. Wagner's work is considered a significant step towards the dissolution of tonality and the emergence of the more atonal and chromatic music of the 20th century. 

      2. **Gustav Mahler:** An Austrian composer and conductor, Mahler was deeply influenced by Wagner's use of the orchestra and the integration of vocal and symphonic elements. His symphonies, especially the later ones, show Wagnerian traits.

      3. **Claude Debussy:** A French composer, Debussy admired Wagner's innovative harmonic language. While he later distanced himself from Wagner's influence, traces of Wagnerian chromaticism can be found in some of Debussy's early works.

      4. **Arnold Schoenberg:** An Austrian composer, Schoenberg initially admired Wagner but later developed his own atonal and twelve-tone techniques. Nevertheless, Wagner's impact on Schoenberg's early works is evident. It's important to note that while these composers were influenced by Wagner, they also developed their unique styles and contributed to diverse musical movements, including late-Romanticism, impressionism, and the move towards atonality in the 20th century.

7. Stravinky's `Firebird`
   - Objective expressionism or aestheticism
      1. Extending the `triad` to `7th`, `9th`, `11th`, `13th`
      2. Introduction of polytonality: e.g. a single chord including Cmaj  triad + F#maj triad
      3. Here we can have refreshing ambiguities, but still within limits (like a chold shower in Bernstein's own words)
      4. A `respectful distance` so that its not personal emotions but those of the collective subconscious of a primitive tribe
      5. Lots of [vernacular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeQXTnv_xU) in Stravinsky that resonated with virtually all vernaculars across the world
         
   - Rennaissnace from Subjective expressive impressionist stuff from all the arts at the time
   - Note that it retains expressionism but with less navel-gazing
   - Contemplating a world to which the composer is affectively attached 
      1. Petrushka:: the world of the Russian carnival
      2. Le Sacre du printemps:: dream world of a pagan Russia
      3. Musically encoding what these meant to him (the composer)
