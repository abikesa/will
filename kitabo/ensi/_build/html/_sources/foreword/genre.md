# Genres

To explore the genres of gospel music with a focus on harmonic tension, we'll consider the progression from traditional gospel through to jazz-influenced contemporary Christian music. This progression often mirrors an increase in harmonic complexity, including the use of extended chords such as sevenths, ninths, elevenths, and thirteenths, which contribute to a richer, more tension-filled sound.

### 1. Traditional Gospel
**Harmonic Characteristics:** Primarily uses triads (major and minor chords) and dominant sevenths. The harmonic language is relatively straightforward, focusing on the I, IV, V, and sometimes vi chords. Tension is minimal, typically resolved quickly within the progression.

### 2. Worship
**Harmonic Characteristics:** Begins to incorporate more suspended chords (sus2, sus4) and added tone chords (add9, add11) to create a more ethereal, contemplative atmosphere. Still leans on basic chord structures but with slight increases in tension through non-diatonic chords.

### 3. Churchy (Gospel Blues)
**Harmonic Characteristics:** Marked by the increased use of dominant sevenths, ninths, and blues scales. This style introduces more chromaticism, especially in passing chords, creating moderate tension that is still resolved in a predictable gospel context.

### 4. R&B/Early Contemporary Christian
**Harmonic Characteristics:** Incorporates extended chords more freely, such as major and minor sevenths, ninths, and sometimes elevenths. The harmonic language is richer, with increased use of chord substitutions and secondary dominants, leading to moderate to high tension.

### 5. Jazz/Late Contemporary Christian
**Harmonic Characteristics:** Characterized by a sophisticated use of extended chords (major 7ths, dominant 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths), modal interchange, and altered chords (e.g., #11, b9). Harmonic tension is significantly higher, with complex chord progressions and less predictable resolutions, often employing modal and tonal ambiguity.

| `Rhythm`/Early      | 7ths, 9ths, Elevenths                       | Moderate to High       | [Secondaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uptown_Girl)|70s|

*An Innocent Man, released in 1983, served as a homage to genres of music which Joel had grown up with in the 1950s, such as rhythm and blues and doo-wop; this release featured "Tell Her About It", "Uptown Girl" and "The Longest Time", three of his best-known songs*

This table highlights the gradual increase in harmonic tension across gospel music genres, illustrating the evolution from simple triadic harmonies to complex jazz-infused chord structures. The use of extended and altered chords not only enriches the harmonic palette but also reflects a deeper emotional and spiritual expression within the music.

# Timelines

Creating a timeline for the development and dominance of these gospel music styles requires a broad brush, as these transitions weren't abrupt but rather gradual evolutions influenced by cultural, social, and technological changes. Here's a simplified timeline that outlines when each style became prominent:

### Timeline of Gospel Music Styles

1. **Traditional Gospel**
   - **Era:** Early 20th Century (1920s onwards)
   - **Key Features:** Rooted in African American spirituals, hymns, and blues. Characterized by straightforward harmonies and a strong emotional message.
   - **Notable Figures:** Thomas A. Dorsey, Mahalia Jackson.

2. **Worship**
   - **Era:** Mid 20th Century (1950s-1960s)
   - **Key Features:** Emerges with the rise of praise and worship music within church services, focusing on adoration and contemplation.
   - **Notable Development:** The growth of charismatic movements and Christian liturgical music, influencing the broader adoption in evangelical circles.

3. **Churchy (Gospel Blues)**
   - **Era:** Mid to Late 20th Century (1960s-1970s)
   - **Key Features:** A blend of gospel music with blues and jazz elements, reflecting a deeper integration of African American musical traditions.
   - **Notable Figures:** James Cleveland, [Andraé Crouch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvIxwc90BEI) (bridging into contemporary styles).

4. **R&B/Early Contemporary Christian**
   - **Era:** Late 20th Century (1970s-1980s)
   - **Key Features:** Gospel music starts incorporating elements from R&B and soul music, leading to a more contemporary sound that appealed to a younger audience.
   - **Notable Figures:** Kirk Franklin, Fred Hammond.

5. **Jazz/Late Contemporary Christian**
   - **Era:** Late 20th Century to Early 21st Century (1980s-present)
   - **Key Features:** Incorporates complex jazz harmonies and rhythms, representing the pinnacle of harmonic tension in gospel music with a sophisticated sound palette.
   - **Notable Figures:** [Israel Houghton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBGd4gsu35c), Jonathan McReynolds (also blending with other contemporary sounds).

This timeline showcases the evolution of gospel music from its roots in traditional spirituals and hymns, through the incorporation of various musical influences such as blues, R&B, and jazz, culminating in the sophisticated harmonic language of contemporary Christian music. It's important to note that these styles and periods overlap and influence each other, with many artists and congregations blending elements from different eras and styles.
