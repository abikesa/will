Given your commitments and the comprehensive nature of your Gospel Music University course, creating a structured daily practice regimen that fits within your available time and addresses your areas for improvement is essential. Your goal is to enhance your ability to accurately pick melodies, fluidly reharmonize melodies, and improve your piano skills, all within the context of black gospel music. With mornings and workdays already committed, your primary practice time is in the evenings after your classes and on weekends.

### Daily Structure Overview

Given your class schedule (Monday-Saturday, with varying times on Saturday) and your commitment to swimming or gym from 5am-7am, your available practice times are in the evenings after your classes and work, and more flexible times on Sunday. Your focus areas can be divided across the week to ensure balanced improvement in all aspects.

### Monday to Friday Schedule

- **7pm-8pm (Dinner and Break):** After your work and before your classes, use this time to relax and have dinner. A clear mind will help you absorb more during your classes.

- **8pm-10pm (Post-Class Practice):**
  - **Monday & Wednesday (Melody and Ear Training):** Focus on exercises that improve your ability to pick melodies with accuracy. Use software tools like EarMaster or functional ear trainer apps, focusing on gospel melodies.
  - **Tuesday & Thursday (Reharmonization):** Practice reharmonizing melodies in various keys, focusing on creating different affects and moods. Start with simpler melodies and gradually increase complexity.
  - **Friday (Piano Drills):** Engage in structured piano drills that focus on gospel music techniques, including arpeggios of the 7 chords in all keys and rhythm patterns that emphasize the bounce of gospel music.

### Saturday Schedule

- **After 12pm (Extended Practice Session):**
  - **12:30pm-2:30pm:** Allocate this time for a longer, more focused practice session. Alternate between your focus areas, dedicating 30 minutes to each.
  - **Break and Leisure Time:** After intense practice, ensure you have some leisure time to relax and recharge.

### Sunday Schedule (Flex Day)

- **Morning (Optional Light Practice or Rest):** Given your intensive week, you may choose to rest or engage in light, enjoyable music practice, such as playing favorite pieces or improvisation.
- **Afternoon (Review and Prepare):** Use this time to review what you've learned over the past week and prepare for the upcoming classes. This could involve organizing your notes, identifying areas needing more focus, and setting goals for the coming week.

### Tips for Success

1. **Set Specific Goals:** For each practice session, have a clear goal. This could be mastering a particular melody, improving a reharmonization technique, or achieving a new level of comfort with specific piano drills.

2. **Record Your Practice:** Occasionally record your practice sessions. Listening back can help identify areas for improvement and track progress over time.

3. **Use Technology:** Make use of apps and software for ear training and music theory. These can provide structured exercises and track your progress.

4. **Stay Connected with Your Peers:** Engage with your classmates for mutual support. Sharing tips and progress can be motivating and enlightening.

5. **Mindful Practice:** Quality over quantity. Ensure that your practice time is focused and mindful, rather than just going through the motions.

6. **Seek Feedback:** Use your instructors' office hours or community forums to get feedback on your progress, especially in areas you're struggling with.

Balancing your schedule with structured, focused practice sessions tailored to your learning objectives, while also ensuring you have adequate rest and recovery time, will be key to making consistent progress in your gospel music studies.
