   - Outstanding voicing in "Casablanca"
      - Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
      - I haven't the slightest idea.
      - Rick is [completely neutral](http://www.vincasa.com/casabla.pdf) about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
      - You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
      - Richarcd Blaine, American. Age, thirty-seve. Cannot return to his country.
      - The reason is a little `vague`. We also know what you did in Paris, Mr. Blaine, and also we know why you left Paris.
      - Don't worry. We are not going to broadcast it
      - Are my eyes really brown?
      - You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us
      - My interest in whether Victor Laszio stays or goes is purely a sporting one
      - In this case, you have no sympany for the fox, huh?
      - Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
      - `Segues` to scene with Victor Laszlo and Ms. Ilsa Lund arriving at Rick's
         - What a voice lead!!!
         - From stuff Rick is "indifferent" to
         - To stuff Rick "hideth" from
            - "whineth" to "hideth" is a regression from young adult responsibility to helplessness of infancy
            - Rick was a lover; whatever backstory there in the US may have seen Rick "tameth" and run afoul of worthy adversaries (no victory)
            - Or was it Paris? Where the Reich "commandeth"
               - Hideth, whineth, tameth; `seeketh`, findeth, commandeth. Casablanca is about seeking a pathway to Lisbon
               - Every one hideth from, avoideth the Reich in Paris. And seeketh a way to America
         - In a few minutes "As time goes by" is going to twinkle off the piano
         - And the rest is Cinematic history!
         - Here the melody isn't mere "song" from the harmonics and acoustics, but art
         - Its chord progression, summoning harmonics way beyond the triad; repressed memories
6. Life: Eternal Recurrence

This overview encapsulates the intricate interplay between various musical, philosophical, and existential constructs as they are mirrored in life and art, particularly through the lens of "Casablanca." Here's a summarization:

### 1. **Construct: Harmonic Series**
The harmonic series serves as the bedrock of musical theory, illustrating how a fundamental note comprises not only its primary tone but a spectrum of harmonics, each adding richness and complexity. This principle finds a narrative parallel in "Casablanca," where the layered personalities and their intertwined stories create a resonant and multifaceted narrative, much like a symphony composed of various harmonious frequencies.

### 2. **Metaphysics: Equal Temperament**
Equal temperament embodies the philosophical compromise between the pure intervals of the harmonic series and the practical necessity of key modulation in music. "Casablanca" reflects this balance through its portrayal of characters navigating a morally ambiguous world, making pragmatic choices in the face of emotional and ethical dilemmas. Rick's café serves as a microcosm of this equilibrium, a neutral zone amidst the chaos of war.

### 3. **Physics: Wave Theory**
Wave theory's exploration of sound through frequency, amplitude, and timbre, and its organizational hierarchy, mirrors the complex dynamics of "Casablanca." The characters and their interactions generate a narrative interference pattern, rich with wit, humor, and subtlety, demanding an engaged and intelligent audience to fully appreciate the depth of its storytelling.

### 4. **Song: Freudian Ensemble**
The Freudian Ensemble in "Casablanca," with characters embodying aspects of the ego, superego, and id, illustrates the psychological underpinnings of the narrative. Rick's struggle between neutrality (ego) and moral action (superego) against his desires (id) forms the core emotional melody of the story, with music—specifically "As Time Goes By"—acting as a key to unlock repressed memories and feelings.

### 5. **Art: Triads, Extended, Altered**
The progression from simple triads to complex extended and altered chords in music parallels the character development and narrative complexity of "Casablanca." As characters evolve and the plot thickens, the emotional landscape of the film deepens, akin to the harmonic richness achieved through musical complexity.

### 6. **Life: Hideth, Whineth, Tameth**
The themes of concealment, victory, and facing destiny in "Casablanca" echo the existential rhythms of life itself. Characters navigate their hidden truths (Hideth), celebrate their triumphs (Whineth), and confront their fates (Tameth), encapsulating the human experience's existential beats.

### **"Casablanca" as a Mirror of Life and Art**
Through its narrative, "Casablanca" embodies these constructs, demonstrating how life's complexity, like music, is composed of various elements—construct, metaphysics, physics, song, art—that together form a coherent and resonant whole. The film's dialogue, characterized by its wit and depth, demands an audience's intellectual engagement, reflecting the nuanced interplay of these themes. Comparatively, Tyler Perry's movies, with their direct and relatable dialogue, offer a modern reflection on contemporary issues, showcasing the diversity of storytelling and its capacity to connect with audiences across different times and societal contexts.

In sum, the multifaceted nature of "Casablanca" serves as a poignant example of how art imitates life, blending the scientific precision of music theory with the emotional depth of human experience to create a story that resonates across generations.
