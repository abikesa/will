Your framework intriguingly combines elements of music theory, metaphysics, and cultural critique to offer a profound analysis of artistic progression, authenticity, and the complexity of human and artistic evolution. Let's explore this framework through the lenses you've outlined, weaving together the construct of the harmonic series, the philosophical implications of equal temperament, the physics of sound, the narrative power of song, the evolution of art, and the rhythm of life itself.

### 1. Construct: Harmonic Series as a Blueprint for Progression

The harmonic series represents the foundation of musical harmony, where each note contains a spectrum of harmonics that contribute to its timbre. This concept parallels the development of a protagonist or an artist, who must evolve beyond simple, fundamental identities (the basic triad) into more complex and nuanced versions of themselves (secondary dominants, chord extensions). This mirrors the journey from a simplistic self-presentation to a more layered and authentic self-expression, as seen in Amerie's evolution from "1 Thing" to asserting a multifaceted identity in "Touch."

### 2. Metaphysics: Equal Temperament as Compromise

Equal temperament, the tuning system that adjusts the pitch of notes to allow music to be played in any key with the same relative accuracy, symbolizes the philosophical balance between `ideal purity and practical necessity. This compromise` is crucial in both music and life, enabling versatility and adaptability. It reflects the necessity of navigating between one's authentic self and societal expectations, as echoed in Marilyn Monroe's acknowledgment of her complexities and imperfections.

### 3. Physics: Wave Theory and Authenticity

The physics of sound, particularly the principles of wave theory, illustrate how harmony and dissonance are natural and essential aspects of music and, metaphorically, of life. The presence of harmonics enriches sound, providing depth and complexity, akin to the multifaceted nature of human experiences and identities. This richness is essential for authenticity, suggesting that true self-expression encompasses both harmony and dissonance, coherence and complexity.

### 4. Song: Narrative Journey

The song serves as a narrative medium, embodying the protagonist's journey through dialogue and monologue, harmonizing metaphysics and physics. It represents the solo protagonist's evolution, highlighting the conflict and resolution inherent in personal growth and artistic development. This journey is evident in the thematic and stylistic evolution of artists like Amerie and Marilyn Monroe, who navigate between public perceptions and personal truths.

### 5. Art: Chord Progressions and Identity

Artistic progression, much like life's journey, is marked by tensions and resolutions. The transition from simple harmonic structures to more complex chord progressions and tonalities symbolizes the evolution of an individual or an artist's identity. This progression reflects the journey from an indifferent or passive state, through enabling or active phases, to a proactive or antagonistic stance against limitations, craving resolution and growth.

### 6. Life: Rhythm and Groove

Finally, life itself can be understood through the concepts of pocket and groove, the rhythmic foundation that underpins music. This metaphor extends to the rhythm of existence, where timing and interaction create harmony and coherence. Life, like music, is a dance of interconnected movements and moments, emphasizing the importance of living in harmony with the world's beat and recognizing the interconnectedness of all experiences.

In this framework, artists like Tyler Perry represent a cautionary tale of achieving commercial success without artistic evolution, highlighting the importance of depth, complexity, and authenticity in artistic expression. This contrast underscores the critical balance between commercial achievements and the need for continuous artistic growth and evolution, echoing the broader themes of authenticity, complexity, and progression in both art and life.
