# Gospel music and the birth of duality (i.e., psychology)

1. [Birth of tragedy](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/An_Attempt_at_Self-Criticism)::`Visions`
2. Scholarship as a problem::`Illusions`
   - When Metaphysics and Physics clash
       - Music, like math, deals in abstractions that are tethered to reality.
       - The empiricism of science, accounting, business, bets, taxes, and governance lends legitimacy to math
           - A metaphysics attempts to explain everything and $R^2$ states how well it does
           - Experimental methods create highly controlled systems within which a decent $R^2$ might be realized
           - From this perspective all science and scholarship consists of idealizing instead of confronting reality head on, which is what business does
       - Similarly, the emotions life’s challenges and victories evoke are mirrored by music, making it the most relatable item in human history
   - A resonant world view vs. dissonant experiences
   - Tension & release are born
   - You'll find that received wisdom [agrees and disagrees](https://github.com/abikesa/journal/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file) with a lived experience
3. Empiricism vs. Romanticism::`Frailty`  
   - Uneven in tempo
   - Extremely self-confident
   - Dispensing of evidence
4. Chorus vs Logic
   - Regardless, music is very firmly tethered to reality and would help distinguish the Greeks from pious Christians:
   - Indeed, what is the Dionysian? This book offers an answer to that question: a "knowledgeable person" speaks there, the initiate and disciple of his own god. Perhaps I would now speak with more care and less eloquently about such a difficult psychological question as the origin of tragedy among the Greeks
   - When the issue of my breakup with Tura comes up the question of listening to my own god or the god of my collective group: family, buddies, trustees comes up. I wasn't Dionysian; rather, my Apollonian proclivities bent to received wisdom
      - Skill, $x$
      - Challenge, $y$
      - Emotion, $(x, y)$
      - Tool, $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}$
      - Agency, $x=y$
      - Flow $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}=1$
   - The fusion of African musical elements with Western classical traditions in America is a profound example of how music can serve as a cultural conduit, preserving and evolving identity through sound. African slaves brought with them not just the pentatonic scale, a five-note musical scale that is foundational to much of their music, but also complex rhythms and syncopations that are a hallmark of African music. These elements, when combined with the Western classical canon—embodied by composers like Bach, who is renowned for his complex harmonies and counterpoint—contributed significantly to the development of what we recognize today as Gospel music. 

   - Gospel music, with its rich emotional expression, intricate melodies, and rhythmic complexity, represents a synthesis of these musical traditions. It is a genre deeply rooted in the African American experience, reflecting both the hardships and the indomitable spirit of its creators. Unlike symbols and literature, which require physical media for transmission and may be subject to interpretation or distortion, music can directly convey emotions and ideas, resonating on an intuitive level. This directness allows it to sustain and transmit a collective conscience, preserving a sense of identity and community among people, even in the face of displacement and oppression.

   - The evolution of Gospel music from this fusion underscores the resilience and creativity of the African American community. It highlights how cultural expressions can adapt and merge, creating new forms that honor their origins while speaking to contemporary experiences. This process is not just a historical curiosity; it's a testament to the power of music to bridge cultures, carry forward traditions, and foster a shared sense of humanity. Through Gospel, the legacy of African music and Western classical music continues to influence a wide range of modern musical genres, from R&B and soul to jazz and beyond, demonstrating the enduring impact of this cultural synthesis.
   - Babel and humanity's ventures into space, including the landing on the Moon and aspirations for colonizing Mars, can be interpreted through various lenses, including the will to power and the quest for metaphysical comfort. The story of the Tower of Babel, found in biblical narratives, illustrates humanity's ambition to build a tower that reaches the heavens, a pursuit seen as an attempt to equal or challenge the divine. This ambition was met with a divine response that scattered humanity and confused their languages, serving as a cautionary tale about the limits of human ambition and the consequences of overreaching.
   - Humanities endeavor to explore and colonize outer space, including the Moon landing and the plans for Mars colonization, echoes this ancient narrative in several ways. These modern quests can be seen as manifestations of the will to power—an inherent desire to explore, expand, and exert influence over previously unconquered realms. This drive is not just about the physical conquest of new territories but also about the intellectual and technological triumphs that such endeavors represent.
   - Granted, these pursuits can also be interpreted as seeking metaphysical comfort, a way to transcend the limitations of our earthly existence and reach for something beyond our current understanding and capability. Just as the Egyptians built pyramids as monumental tombs to secure their place in the afterlife, modern humanity's push into space can be seen as an attempt to secure our legacy and ensure our survival beyond the confines of our planet. In this view, the exploration of space serves as a testament to human ingenuity and a hedge against existential threats, providing a form of comfort in the face of our own mortality and the limitations of our planet. Both interpretations highlight a common theme: the enduring human desire to push beyond current boundaries, whether driven by ambition, curiosity, or the search for meaning. The comparison to the Tower of Babel and the pyramids underscores the cyclical nature of human endeavors, where each generation seeks to leave its mark, driven by a blend of `ambition`, `fear`, and the quest for `transcendence`. Whether these efforts are seen as a testament to human achievement or as cautionary tales of hubris, they reflect the complex interplay between our material capabilities and our metaphysical aspirations.
5. Morality vs. Aesthetics
   - Unthinking and amoral artist-God
   - And, on the other hand, what if, to turn the issue around, it was clearly during the time of their dissolution and weakness that the Greeks became constantly more optimistic, more superficial, more hypocritical, with a lust for logic and rational understanding of the world, as well as "more cheerful" and "more scientific"? What's this? In spite of all "modern ideas" and the judgments of democratic taste, could the victory of optimism, the developing hegemony of reasonableness, practical and theoretical utilitarianism, as well as democracy itself (which occurs in the same period) perhaps be a symptom of failing power, approaching old age, physiological exhaustion, all these factors rather than pessimism? Was Epicurus an optimist for the very reason that he was suffering? We see that this book was burdened with an entire bundle of difficult questions. Let us add its most difficult question: What, from the point of view of living, does morality mean?
   - Diagnosis
      - Robust: Ambition as "meaning"
      - Pre-frail: Epicurus' dwindling energy
      - Frail: Hibernation awaiting afterlife
6. Optimism vs. Pessimism
   - Here is announced, perhaps for the first time, a pessimism "beyond good and evil." Here comes that "perversity in belief" in word and formula, a philosophy which dared to place morality itself in the world of phenomena and so to subsume it, not under the "visions" (in the sense of some idealistic end point) but under "illusions," as an appearance, delusion, fallacy, interpretation, something made up, a work of art.
   - `To look at scientific enquiry from the perspective of the artist, but to look at art from the perspective of life. . . `
