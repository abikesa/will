    "_Colors Match our Neural Network Model_. Mental state in terms of challenge level and skill level, according to [Csikszentmihalyi's flow model](https://news.uchicago.edu/story/mihaly-csikszentmihalyi-pioneering-psychologist-and-father-flow-1934-2021). The low-skill of anxiety speaks to adversarial transformation, very dynamic in nature that one can only adapt to but never really be well trained for. By contrast, the high-skill of relaxation speaks to culturual homogeneity embodied in heritage, which most adults have mastered. Flow speaks to transactional tokenized settings, wherein rules are somewhat well established -- but there's dynamism that leaks in from adversarial settings.\n",
