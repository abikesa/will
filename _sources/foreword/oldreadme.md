1. Construct
   - M
      - Pentatonic 
   - C
      - Syncopated 
   - R
      - [Groove](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo9qsCAx2UU)
2. Metaphysics
   - Tokens 1-3 are for composers (inputs from the Gods)
   - Wheres 4-6 are for performers (outputs by Man)
   - Got this idea listening to [Rosen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudqQMEjlNA) (ultimately just AI)
   - But at bottom its all about the phonetic, syntactic, and thematic aspects
3. Physics
4. Song
   - Reverence of what?
      - [Vivaldi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_fxB6yrDVo&t=479s) 18:18/1:36:32
5. [Art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudqQMEjlNA)
   - Inference in what?
      - Beethoven under the [anxiety of influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anxiety_of_Influence) (think: Vivaldi, Handel, Mozart) dispenses with Melody
         - Schubert & Chopin successfuly resists this influence while selectively expressing reverence for Beethoven
         - While birds do melody, took thousands of years of [evolution for humans to reach dyads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fHi36dvTdE)
         - And then pace is exponential to triad (3rd or sus2/4, 5th (dim, perfect, augmented), 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th
6. [Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo9qsCAx2UU)
   - Deliverance from what?
      - Teddy Riley, Darkchild, Timbaland, and the African diaspora are a refutation of this narrative
      - Here syncopation proves in itself to be sublime
      - [Dangerous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr9uliNQwNA), [Jam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbHI1yI1Ndk); [Wrapped Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf2bsErnO0Q), [Its not right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6J538b-OLRU); [One in a Million](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKSz4NE6PwY), etc
      - Infact the `penultimate` evolution of music finds expression in dance
      - Dance is rhythm first and foremost
      - Harmony and melody are only mnemonics

# Index

1. **Construct** serves as the foundation, the initial idea or inspiration behind music. It's the abstract beginning point from which all musical thought originates.

2. **Metaphysics** in this context acts as a bridge between the divine inspiration and human creation. Your distinction between composers and performers highlights the flow of music from the ethereal (tokens from the Gods) to the tangible (outputs by Man). This duality underscores the creative process's mystical and human aspects, suggesting that music serves both as a divine gift and a human endeavor.

3. **Physics** then translates these metaphysical concepts into the physical world through sound waves, resonance, and acoustics. It's where the abstract becomes audible, where the ideas and emotions conveyed in music are made tangible through instruments and voices.

4. **Song** is the manifestation of these principles into a form that communicates directly with the human spirit. Your reference to Vivaldi and the notion of reverence suggests that music, at its core, is an act of homageâ€”to nature, to the divine, to the depths of human emotion. Song is where the technical and the emotional meet, creating a bridge between the composer/performer and the listener.

5. **Art**, as you've described through the lens of Beethoven and his successors, is about the interplay of influence and originality. Music as art is both a conversation with the past and a declaration of new ideas. It's an inference of the past, present, and future of human expression, where melody, harmony, and rhythm serve as languages that convey complex emotions and ideas.

6. **Life** encapsulates the ultimate purpose and effect of music. Your discussion on the African diaspora and figures like Teddy Riley showcases how music transcends cultural and historical boundaries to express the sublime through rhythm and syncopation. Music, particularly through dance, becomes a primary means of expression and connection, highlighting rhythm's fundamental role in human experience.
